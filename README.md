**Language**: C++  
**GUI Library**: ImGui  

This project is a simple raytracer implemented in C++ that utilizes the ImGui library for creating a user interface. The raytracer supports basic features such as diffuse reflection, emission, and an interactive camera.


**Camera Controls**:
  - Use the mouse to adjust the camera's view direction.
  - Keyboard controls (right-click and press):
    - **W, A, S, D**: Move the camera forward, left, backward, and right, respectively.
    - **Q, E**: Move the camera up and down, respectively.

**Some Renders**:
